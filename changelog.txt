## Version 1.2.0 ##
Thanks to the following people who contributed to this release!
- Dawnraider
- Hiracho
- Sockthing

/--General--/
- Updated the title splashes.
- Fixed an issue where config options were not being properly saved.
- Fixed an issue where better grass did not work for mycelium.
- Fixed an issue where better grass did not work for grass slabs.

/--Gameplay--/
- Added several new systems to update more crops to vegehenna. These changes are detailed individually further below. Note that this will be expanded upon in future releases to eventually update all crops to vegehenna standards.
- Added the ability to silk touch clay ore, and removed the ability to convert old vanilla clay into unfired clay (as that was done by using clay ore's item id). It has been long enough since the original clay change that I find it very unlikely people still have clay that has not been converted.
- Added the ability to use fortune on clay ore to increase the amount of clay dropped.
- Added the diamond armor plate, and renamed the steel one to differentiate it. It may be crafted with 2 leather straps with a diamond ingot in the middle, and padding below the diamond ingot. The steel armor plate recipe has also been tweaked to match for consistency.
- Changed diamond armor to require diamond armor plates in a similar manner to steel armor (straps replacing the shoulders and legs, and added on the chin, for 7 total), though the recipes still use the 3x3 anvil. This should hopefully allow iron armor a bit of room to breathe by making diamond armor a tad more expensive and slightly lossy when melted down.
- Changed sheep to display their original wool color when shorn.
- Changed wicker baskets to return all the wicker used in crafting them instead of only 1 to make the transition to hampers less frustrating given the sugar cane changes below.
- Changed hamper's selection and hit boxes to better match their model.
- Changed sails to be crafted with 3 fabric instead of 6 to reduce the amount of time spent early game waiting for hemp to grow. This should also make hardcore spawns across oceans slightly less punishing.
- Changed (reduced) the maximum hardcore spawn range after entering the end to scale linearly with the other range increases instead of being dramatically higher.
- Changed (reduced) the lockout timer on being assigned a new spawn location after dying. Now if you die after night falls you should be assigned a new location instead of simply death looping until morning. This should hopefully reduce some of the frustration of dying again immediately after a hardcore spawn.
- Changed (increased) the minimum food value for the player on rapid respawns within the same day so that the player should no longer respawn unable to jump.
- Removed the scaling minimum distance for hardcore spawn. The minimum is now fixed with only the maximum scaling in order to increase the chances of landing on old bases to generally make HCS reward overworld infrastructure more.
- Removed the water bucket from the bread dough recipe as it made bread a pain to craft.
- Fixed an issue where wolves would eat loose food on the ground even when not hungry.

Vegehenna:
- Added sugar cane roots, which are now required to grow sugar cane as the sugar cane item may no longer be planted (though it may still be placed on top of plants with roots). New roots can be bought from the farmer or found by exploring, as newly generated sugar cane plants will generate with roots which can be picked up and moved. The growth rate of sugar cane has been increased to offset new plants being much more rare. Old sugarcane plants will continue to function as normal so as to not break builds. Old plants will also drop roots when their base block is broken to make conversion easier.
- Added a new carrot item, which is used for the new carrot crops. Old carrots will function as they used to so as to not break old builds. A crafting recipe has been provided to convert old carrots to new carrots.
- Added a new flowering carrot plant, which can be obtained by planting a whole carrot. Flowering carrots drop carrot seeds when harvested.
- Added a new carrot plant grown from carrot seeds, which drops a single carrot when harvested. Both kinds of carrot plants use daily growth like wheat.
- Changed the textures for carrots and wheat crops.
- Changed (increased) the chance of villages to have carrots or potatoes slightly to make explorating for them a little less frustrating.
- Changed (increased) the base growth level of crops in villages to reduce the amount of waiting necessary to be able to harvest the crops.
- Changed saplings to drop their current growth stage when broken instead of reverting to base.
- Changed saplings to grow faster when fertilized.
- Changed saplings to not grow into trees when placed in unfertilized planters. Be careful though, as fertilized saplings may find planters too restrictive for their growing root system.
- Removed the ability to craft melons into slices by hand, making the saw now the only way to do so. This makes melons less effective as a source of food while travelling by decreasing their efficiency in inventory. Note that seeds may still be obtained without a saw by dropping the melon from a sufficiently high location.
- Fixed an issue where pumpkins or melons exploding could cause seeds to get stuck in neighboring blocks.

/--Creative Mode--/
- Fixed an issue where farmland returned loose dirt when using pick block.

/--Addon API--/
- Added hooks to define custom tile entity renderers without a base class edit.
- Added hooks to define valid biomes for biome-specific generators: pumpkins, sugar cane, villages
- Added hooks to determine whether a particular addon is installed.
- Added hooks to allow for mutual replacement of blocks and items between addons by allowing one addon to define its replacement as able to override the replacement of another addon.
- Fixed an issue where addons with no config options defined would display an error to the console.

## Version 1.1.8 ##
/--Gameplay--/
- Changed (increased) the chance of breeding villagers producing a villager of a different profession than the parents.
- Fixed an issue where TNT exploding could still cause a crash in some instances.
- Fixed an issue where chopping logs with a stone axe always produced oak bark.

/--Addon API--/
- Added the ability for addons to add custom villagers to existing castes in order to allow addon villagers to be bred from vanilla ones.
- Added the ability for addons to define their own castes for villager breeding.
- Fixed an issue where defining villager professions with non-consecutive ids would cause the game to crash when a villager of that profession was created.

## Version 1.1.7 ##
Thanks to the following people who contributed to this release!
- Dawnraider
- Zhil

/--General--/
- Fixed an issue where falling sand would generate an error on chunk generation.
- Fixed an issue where comparators had the wrong recipe.
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash when a platform began moving.
- Fixed an issue where the game could crash when a max level villager tried to refresh its trades.

## Version 1.1.6 ##
/--Gameplay--/
-Fixed an issue where the saw and kiln could output items with 0 stack size.

## Version 1.1.5 ##
/--Gameplay--/
- Fixed an issue where diamond shears could not be used to cut leather.
- Fixed an issue where hemp could not be harvested using shears.
- Fixed an issue where placing a brick in multiplayer would crash the server.
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash upon entering the end.
- Fixed an issue where throwing an egg would crash the game.
- Fixed an issue where throwing a snowball would crash the game.
- Fixed an issue where lighting a powder keg would crash the game.
- Fixed an issue where casting a fishing rod would crash the game.

## Version 1.1.4 ##
Sorry to keep spamming releases, the new entity spawning code touched a lot of places and I was bound to miss a few while testing.

/--Gameplay--/
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash when throwing a splash potion.

## Version 1.1.3 ##
/--Gameplay--/
- Fixed an issue where diamond chisels were unable to split stone into stone bricks.
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash when trying to spawn a lightning bolt.

## Version 1.1.2 ##
/--General--/
- Fixed an issue where clients would crash in multiplayer when more than one person joined the server.

## Version 1.1.1: ##
Thanks to the following people who contributed to this release!
- Dawnraider
- rockoutwill

/--Gameplay--/
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash when attempting to spill items out from a mod inventory which was broken.

/--Addon API--/
- Changed how reflective constructor calls are handled to be less strict about primitives which can normally be passed as arguments.
- Fixed an issue where the game would crash on load when trying to reflectively use a block or item constructor that was not the first constructor defined for that type.

## Version 1.1.0: ##
This release will cause issues with craftguide. It will definitely no longer be able to display kiln and saw recipes, but may cause bigger issues than that. I am unfamiliar with the craftguide codebase but I am definitely willing to work with anyone who is to get it functional again. Once it is fixed though, it should have increased functionality due to how a lot of the BTW-specific recipes are now handled.

Also, apologies to addon authors for breaking things so soon again, this will also break any addons which use custom recipe classes or which add recipes for the saw, kiln, piston packing, or secondary output recipes.

/--General--/
- Refactored the code for the skin fix to be less janky.
- Removed the config option for skin URLs since it is no longer necessary with the integration of Zhil's skin fix.

/--Gameplay--/
- Added diamond shears, crafted in the same manner as iron shears. Diamond shears do not take durability damage when used in crafting. This and the chisel below use the same id as deco's item, so they will be counted as the same item for those using deco (once deco is updated for CE).
- Added diamond chisels, crafted with a single diamond ingot. Diamond chisels do not take durability damage when used in crafting.
- Added the ability to filter wheat through a wicker filter in a hopper to separate out seeds and straw, allowing for automated farming of wheat once again.
- Added the ability to create chicken feed in a cauldron.
- Added the ability to apply mortar using a vanilla dispenser facing a block which can accept mortar.
- Added a config option to disable nausea from grinding netherrack in the millstone.
- Added a config option to enable hardcore soulmating after the nether has been accessed. If this is enabled, players will always spawn together after dying, regardless of progression.
- Added the ability to craft the comparator, using the same recipe as the repeater but with a redstone eye in place of the clock, and a third redstone torch above the middle.
- Added the ability for the comparator to read the contents of the hopper. This replaces the previous functionality where the hopper would output power when full, which has been removed. This also fixes an issue where a full hopper would permanently lock a dispenser placed below it.
- Changed the redstone eye to be crafted using only a single row of lapis, and moved it to be craftable on a normal crafting table.
- Changed regular and detector rails to be crafted with 6 iron nuggets instead of ingots. Regular rails now produce 12 instead of 16, while detector rails still produce 6.
- Changed powered rails to be crafted with 6 iron nuggets for the rails, a stick in the center, and a redstone latch in the bottom center, still producing 6.
- Changed wolves to be bred using mystery meat, and removed all restrictions on wolves entering breeding mode, including allowing wild wolves to breed.
- Changed wolves to get extra excited after killing a player.
- Changed the player to drop less mystery meat from being fat, but increased the minimum slightly (from 1-11 to 2-4).
- Changed the player to drop rotten flesh when bound to a soulforged steel beacon. The previous behavior was encouraging the player to construct suicide booths in order to obtain large quantities of mystery meat. Sacrificing villagers (preferably with a looting weapon or beacon) is the intended way to do so.
- Changed (increased) the amount of mystery meat dropped by villagers from 1-2 to 1-3.
- Changed (increased) the amount of leather dropped by cows from 0-2 to 1-3 to make investing the effort to kill a cow feel a little more rewarding.
- Changed (increased) the number of feathers dropped by chickens from 0-2 to 1-3. This, along with the arrow change, should hopefully make feathers feel like less of a restrictive resource.
- Changed arrows to once again craft 4. Arrows felt far too costly to the point of feeling prohibitive, and it was discouraging players from using bows even into late game.
- Changed the recipe for steel broadheads to produce 2 arrowheads instead of 6 to maintain a similar steel cost for broadhead arrows.
- Changed the number of items traded for the priest's skull trade and several raw meat trades for the butcher to make them consistent with other similar trades.
- Changed (reduced) the price of saddles from the butcher.
- Changed (rebalanced) a few of the outlier librarian trades to be less obnoxious.
- Changed (reduced) the spawn rate of ghasts in the nether. It is still considerably higher than vanilla, but the old spawn rate would spam ghasts and make tunneling the only viable strategy, which was not particularly enjoyable. The nether will still continue to be quite dangerous, but surface travel will at least be possible now. A config option has been provided for those who wish to maintain the old spawn rate.
- Changed blaze powder to be crafted by grinding blaze rods in a millstone. Blaze powder may no longer be crafted by hand.
- Changed vanilla stair recipes to produce 6 instead of 4 to match the stair recipes in BTW.
- Changed rough stone which has been chiseled beyond the first stage to explode into items when picked up by a block dispenser to fix a stone duplication exploit.
- Fixed an issue where burning villagers still dropped cooked meat instead of burned.
- Fixed an issue where sugar cane could be placed inside water.
- Fixed an issue where endermen would forget their aggro status on reloading the world.

/--Creative Mode--/
- Added water and lava source blocks to the creative menu.
- Added powered axles to the creative menu. This allows testing mechanical devices without having to worry about constructing something to generate mechanical power.
- Fixed an issue where jungle spiders were missing spawn eggs.
- Fixed an issue where villager spawn eggs were missing translation entries.

/--Addon API--/
- Rewrote how entity creation is handled. Entities now must go through EntityList.createEntityOfType() in order to be created, which allows for much smoother entity class replacement for addons.
- Added hooks to save global data to level.dat.
- Added the ability to define piston packing recipes which combine multiple items into a single block.
- Changed recipes for hopper filtering, piston packing, the saw, and the kiln to use crafting managers, allowing recipes to be added or modified without overrides.
- Changed secondary recipe outputs to store their secondary outputs in the crafting manager when assigned instead of relying on hardcoded info.
- Changed the kiln cooking overlay to be automatically rendered for blocks which have a kiln recipe so that it no longer needs to be hardcoded in RenderBlockSecondPass()
- Changed the config file handler to regenerate the config file (with the selected options) every time the game is loaded in order to preserve the options order defined by the addon instead of appending any new options to the end of the file
- Changed (refactored) block and item replacement to be a bit more robust. There should not be any addon-facing changes, however.

## Version 1.0.1: ##
Thanks to the following people who contributed to this release!
- Dawnraider
- Hiracho

/--General--/
- Fixed an issue where MCPatcher's Better Grass did not function, and added a config option to enable it (it is disabled by default).

/--Gameplay--/
- Fixed an issue where endermen aggro was calculated incorrectly and could aggro from behind 2 high walls even without line of sight.
- Fixed an issue where mining a piston in the same tick as it extended would cause the game to crash.

/--Addon API--/
- Added hooks to define how many babies should spawn when breeding.
- Fixed an issue where the FCBlockDirectional template was absent.

## Version 1.0.0: ##
This version WILL break any addons using the Extended Addon API, which has been deprecated, with functionality now being integrated into BTW itself. Most changes that are addon-facing are relavtively minor though so updating should be easy. Addons not using the API should be unaffected.

Note that it is not safe to downgrade worlds opened in this release to a previous BTW release as this version changes how villagers are stored in the save file. Old saves can be ported without issue, but they cannot be reverted.

If you are currently using the API, this version will require a clean install.

/-- General --/
- Integrated Extended Addon API into BTW. This is detailed further below. Addons using the API will need to update to be compatible.
- Integrated MCPatcher into BTW.
- Added a version display on the main menu.
- Completely rewrote how config files are handled. It is now automatically generated under config/BTW, and the old config file has been deprecated.
- Removed the config option for minecart changes as it really didn't serve much purpose.
- Fixed an issue where the tops of grass slabs did not respond properly to custom biome colors using MCPatcher.
- Fixed an issue where skins would not show up due to an API change from Mojang. This replaces the need for Zhil's skin fix.

/-- Gameplay --/
- Added the ability to piston pack ender pearls.
- Re-enabled the redstone comparator. It is only available in creative mode for now but will be added to survival at a later date.
- Re-enabled the speed potion effect, although the potions may still not be crafted. This is primarily for addons or custom maps to make use of the effect.
- Added the ability for the comparator to read the contents of the following blocks: block dispenser, cauldron, crucible, millstone, pulley, and vessel of the dragon. Hoppers have their own detection method right now which will be changed in the future once comparators are available in survival.
- Added the ability to uncraft windmills back into sails.
- Changed dirt, grass, and mycelium slabs to turn into loose slabs when their anchor block is lost instead of exploding into items.
- Changed flowers to be crushed by falling blocks to fix an exploit where they could be used to mine dirt in the early game.
- Fixed an issue where baby animals would prioritize following adults over eating and could starve to death if they could not reach any nearby adult they were trying to path to.
- Fixed an issue where baby animals would try to path up jumps too tall for them and get stuck jumping continuously. This doesn't catch all possible edge cases but will catch the majority the player is likely to encounter through normal gameplay. Specifically, if the block has a top surface you can stick things to, babies will not try to path up it. If the block does not have such a top surface but is still more than half a block tall (such as the back side of stairs), the baby will still attempt to path up it. However, this is unlikely to occur unless the player purposefully creates such a scenario.
- Fixed an issue where wolves were unable to be bred. They may now be bred using kibble, but must be hand fed and at full health and hunger (this is what the behavior was before the bug was introduced). This behavior, however, is a placeholder and will be changed in a future release.
- Fixed (theoretically) a bug where players would become invisible to each other when they left each other's loaded chunks in multiplayer. The fix for this was rather hacky, so let me know if anyone still has this bug occur for them.
- Fixed an issue where villager trade weighting was not being applied evenly and was incorrectly biased towards some trades.
- Fixed a vanilla issue where slimes could spawn inside of blocks when splitting, resulting in suffocation or them escaping through walls.

/-- Creative Mode --/
- Added creative mode as an officially supported gamemode. Bug reports and feedback about creative mode are now welcome.
- Added villager spawn eggs for each profession as a result of the below villager change in the API section.
- Changed the creative menu tabs for tuning forks, metal fragments, and bone fish hooks to be more appropriate.
- Removed limitations imposed on creative mode for the following mechanics: possessed cows birthing mutants, wolves converting to beasts, villages spawning zombies, villagers gaining xp, beacon effects, arcane scroll drops, and ender pearls (this was actually vanilla but has been changed for consistency with modern versions of vanilla).
- Fixed an issue where several blocks or items were not present in the creative inventory: vessel of the dragon, detector block, chainmail armor, mail item, crude torch, unlit torch, bloody chopping block, blight, soul sand planter, and farmland (since it can no longer be created in creative mode given the hoe changes). Subblocks will be added eventually but require more work than just adding them to the menu.
- Fixed an issue where the technical block glowing detector logic displayed in the creative inventory.
- Fixed an issue where several blocks gave the wrong result when using pick block: white stone, blight, stone bricks, and wooden sub-blocks.
- Fixed an issue where gamerule doFireTick did not properly disable fire.
- Fixed an issue where equipment defined by custom mob spawners was not being applied to mobs spawned from the spawner.

/-- Addon API --/
Most changes are equivalent to Extended Addon API 1.1.4. Those which are not are either new features, or the differences are specified further in the changelog:
- Added a directional template block like logs which can support up to 4 subtypes.
- Added the ability for addons to add villager professions by splitting professions into their own classes and removing a lot of the hardcoded methods related to trades.
- Added hooks to add and modify villager trades.
- Added hooks to play special effects on level up or when certain trades are performed.
- Added hooks for automatic version checking.
- Added hooks to be able to replace references to existing blocks and items.
- Added hooks to define custom item entities.
- Added hooks to replace custom entities.
- Added hooks for addons to intercept existing client packets to change their behavior.
- Added hooks to define a block's map color per metadata, and optimized map rendering to be more memory-efficient.
- Added hooks to allow an addon to save data as a part of the world file. This data is saved uniquely per dimension.
- Added hooks to allow addons to generate and process config files.
- Added hooks to define custom criteria for mobs spawning during world gen.
- Fixed an issue where trying to remove a cauldron or crucible recipe with fewer outputs than inputs would cause the game to crash on load.
- Fixed a vanilla issue where trying to spawn an entity with an ID above 255 in multiplayer would crash all nearby clients.

Changes from API 1.1.4:
- Changed the name of AddonBlockDirectional to FCBlockDirectional.
- Chnaged how the hooks for defining villager trades work to no longer be hardcoded to the class. All trades are handled through method calls which add them to the appropriate list. Invalid trades are also handled automatically now so hooks for determining if a trade is invalid have been removed.
- Changed version checking to be done in their own methods instead of the generic handler methods. This should not matter for addons unless they implement custom version checking.
- Removed AddonExt. All addon functionality has been moved into FCAddon. No change should be necessary except changing the superclass of addons back to FCAddOn for any which were using the API.
- Removed the server acknowledgement check from addons as it was not functioning properly in some cases (and could spam clients with chat messages). This will be re-introduced at a later date in a better form.
- Fixed an issue where breeding villagers always produced farmers.
- Fixed an issue where villager trade lists were still using 4.B0000002 trades and not the updated versions.
- Fixed an issue where butchers put on their breeding harness a level too early.
- Fixed an issue where replacing entity mappings did not work for spawnable mobs.
